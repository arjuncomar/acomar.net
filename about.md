title: About
---

Hi all, I'm a software developer and consultant living in the
Washington D.C. Metropolitan area. I got my bachelors in
Computer Science from the Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology.

I'm interested in all things software, but especially computer vision
and machine learning. I'm also very interested in the Haskell language
and functional programming.

I'm the author of the [Revelation](https://github.com/arjuncomar/revelation.git)
library that aims to bring idiomatic Haskell bindings to the OpenCV 
computer vision library. As part of this I wrote bindings to the full 
OpenCV API including the C++ only portions. These bindings are available 
at [my fork](https://www.github.com/arjuncomar/opencv_contrib.git).
I am to contribute these bindings and wrappers back to OpenCV proper,
and I'm setting up for inclusion with the 3.0 release.

I'm also working on a simple media server called Jump that will
allow users to set up their own websites to share with friends and family.

My other interests are a bit scattered. I enjoy music, bowyery, weightlifting,
role-playing games, books, beer, and the occasional video game. Posts on these 
topics may occasionally pop up on this blog!
